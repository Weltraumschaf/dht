/**
 * This class represents an observable object.
 *
 * It can be subclassed to represent an object that the application wants to have observed.
 *
 * An observable object can have one or more observers. An observer may be any object that
 * implements interface {@link Observer}. After an observable instance changes, an  application
 * calling the {@link Observable#notifyObservers} method causes all of its observers to be notified
 * of the change by a call to their {@link Observer#update(de.weltraumschaf.neuron.event.Event)} method.
 *
 * The order in which notifications will be delivered is unspecified. The default implementation
 * provided in the {@link DefaultObservable} class will notify {@link Observer observers} in the order in
 * which they registered interest, but subclasses may change this order, use no guaranteed order,
 * deliver notifications on separate threads, or may guarantee that their subclass follows this order,
 * as they choose.
 *
 * Note that this notification mechanism is has nothing to do with threads and is completely separate
 * from the {@link java.lang.Object#wait()} and {@link java.lang.Object#notify()} mechanism of class {@link Object}.
 *
 * When an observable object is newly created, its set of observers is empty. Two observers are considered the same
 * if and only if the {@link java.lang.Object#equals(java.lang.Object)} method returns true for them.
 *
 * This is a copy of {@link java.util.Observable} with customizations.
